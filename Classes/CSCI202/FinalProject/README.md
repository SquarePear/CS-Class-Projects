# CSCI202 Final Project - Library

This is my final project submission for CSCI202 - Data Structures and Algorithms.

It is meant to be a basic library e-book managing software. It is able to keep track of customers, books, and views. The managers can use this program to view or edit this data. All updates will then be saved back to the files to be loaded back on the next use.

I decided to split everything into its own class and files because I knew this was going to be a larger project than my others for this class. This helps with readability and ease of fixing, as the compiler will tell me which lines are having issues. This helped quite a bit when I was dealing with all of the different data structures.

I used a few different data structures based on what each part of the code needed. Ordered and unordered hashmaps, queues, vectors, and multi-maps. They all served separate purposes aiding in the codes accessing of data with certain searches. For example, I stored a list of all the books, customers, and views in their own vectors, but I used maps to access them by using their IDs/ISBNs effectively.

Overall this was a complicated but fun project. I liked how it forced me to use many of the different data structures I learned over this class effectively. I think it helped me understand when to use them even more,
