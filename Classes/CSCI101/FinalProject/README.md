# CSCI101 Final Project - Sorry! Game

My final project was recreating a version of the game [Sorry!](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)>). As this class was the first time coding for many of my classmates, the project was a very simplified version of the game. I managed to get the core framework of the game working after about an hour, but it took quite a bit longer to add in all the different rules and fix the many bugs. I fixed all of the bugs that I found, but there might still be more as the game is purely random chance.
