# CSCI201 Final Project - Tank Game

I made a game where you control a tank through a maze. I used classes to manage the different game objects. I used a few different data structures to keep track of the game. I made custom strucrs for position and the gameInfo given to the enemy tank AIs. I also used vectors to keep a list of the tanks and walls. This program was definitely hard to debag because of the its randomness. If I were to do this project again I would definitely use multi-dimensional arrays instead of vectors to store all of the objects. The vectors led to many issues that were hard to solve and could probably easily be fixed by switching to n-dimensional arrays. Overall I really enjoyed this project. I like how you get more freedom in your project compared to CSCI101, although that definitly made it more difficult.
